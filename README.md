## How to contribute
Lets use this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-apps-script-github/lfjcgcmkmjjlieihflfhjopckgpelofo?hl=en
This helps push code to and from the google apps script. 
1. Install the chrome extension
2. Go to the sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x0BDHCvgq7j71Tsj6w8Fsq0GdYdv_VLSoj_8iKkVC0c/edit#gid=0)
3. Login to Github using the extension
4. And it works!

### Coding, testing
To contribute, pull the code using the extension and test it on your copy of the sheet.

### TO use/test
Go the menu, enter a ISBN {paste an example here} 

TODO: branch conventions, but probably make your own branch for your stuff and merge to master via PR
